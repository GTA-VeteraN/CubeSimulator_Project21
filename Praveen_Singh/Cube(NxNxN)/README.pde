//Cube Simulator

//Here we need to manually change the dimension inside the code.
//Two ways of input:
//1. Automatically Generated moves (Press Space for this).
//2. Manually giving moves through keyboard:
//    For this:
//    a. Firstly Press 'm' to start manual mode.
//    b. Then press one of these keys:
          //i.  (F,B,L,R,U,D) - Outer Slices
          //ii. (f,b,l,r,u,d) - Just inner slice
          //iii.(x,y,z,X,Y,Z) - for all the slices from outer to mid
          //iv. (g,h,i,G,H,I) - Some extra inner slices for dimension greater than 5
          // v. (n,o,p,N,O,P) - Other extra inner slices for dimension greater than 12
//    c. Then press 'e' to indicate end of input.

//Press 's' to stop at any moment and then press the key for the action that was stopped  (like Space or 'a')
//In this case there is no solver part.
